# dissociative-author

The Dissociative Author digests a webpage's text (read using jsoup) into Markov chains. Then it uses those Markov chains to write its own text.

For example, the Author, after digesting Gilman's _The Yellow Wallpaper_, may write a passage like:

"Live fun of July is so. Away, ask Cousin Henry and also a kindly wink the women gets into the knobs of another room! quiet, a shame to turn my windows! order things. different shade, a good report to help to break down to leave before. really fond of my head of fate! plunges of burning the windows and Jennie has an effort is green instead of box-bordered paths, and air and gates that horrid paper. she betrayed herself that makes me!"
